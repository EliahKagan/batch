# batch - some batch files

These are some scripts, mostly small, that I wrote in 2023 while relearning how
to write batch files. (It had been many years.)

I may end up adding more to this repository at some point.

## initialize.cmd

The most significant script at this time is `initialize.cmd`, which I've used
in [at least
one](https://github.com/EliahKagan/VidDraw/blob/master/.devcontainer/initialize.cmd)
other repository. The commit history for the script is more detailed here.

Writing this script was my main motivation in February 2023 for refreshing
myself on how to write batch files.
